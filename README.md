Tourist Place Recommendation System :

1.1	Overview of the Project :
 
This system adopts a hybrid recommendation model, integrating both Content-Based Filtering (based on user input, tags, and search keywords) and Collaborative Filtering (based on similar users' choices and previous behaviors), ensuring a more dynamic, context-aware, and user-centric experience for travelers. By combining the strengths of both approaches, our system caters effectively to both new users, who may not have prior browsing data, and returning users, whose historical activity can be leveraged for refined and more accurate recommendations.
Furthermore, the system is designed with scalability and adaptability in mind, allowing for the incorporation of real-time data sources, seasonal preferences, and even location-aware suggestions in future enhancements. The ultimate aim is to simplify the travel planning experience by providing users with intelligent, relevant, and enjoyable travel options that reflect their unique interests.

1.2 Problem Statement :  

Travel planning might appear simple at first glance, but in reality, users often face multiple challenges when searching for tourist destinations. 

1.3 Objectives :
The primary goal of this project is to design and implement a Tourist Place Recommendation System that delivers accurate, personalized, and efficient suggestions
